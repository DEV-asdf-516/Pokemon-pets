## Download

Get the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/DEV-asdf-516/Pokemon-pets/releases/latest).

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Pokemon-Pet-x.x.x-arm64.dmg` |
| Windows | `Pokemon-Pet-x.x.x-Setup.exe` |
| Linux | `Pokemon-Pet-x.x.x.AppImage` |

## Development

Requires Node.js 20.9+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To launch a specific Pokemon in development mode, pass its pet ID after `--`:

```bash
npm start -- lucario
npm start -- clodsire
npm start -- --clodsire
```

If the app is already running, quit it before starting with a different pet.

## AI provider

Ollama is the default and requires no API key. To switch providers, add the relevant key to `.env` in the project root and update your settings file.

On first launch the app copies `config/setting.json` to a user-writable location. If you need an API key (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini), also place a `.env` file in the same folder.

Files: `setting.json` (provider/model config), `.env` (API keys, optional), `pets/` (editable pet packs)

During development (`npm start`), Electron creates the `pokemon-pet` user-data folder from the app name. A packaged or installed app may use a folder based on its display name depending on the environment.

### macOS

User-data folder: `~/Library/Application Support/pokemon-pet/`

Locate the settings file:

```bash
find "$HOME/Library/Application Support" -maxdepth 3 -name setting.json 2>/dev/null | grep -Ei "pokemon|pet"
```

Reveal the development settings file in Finder:

```bash
open -R "$HOME/Library/Application Support/pokemon-pet/setting.json"
```

### Windows

User-data folder: `%APPDATA%\pokemon-pet\`

Locate the settings file in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "$env:APPDATA" -Filter setting.json -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
  Where-Object { $_.FullName -match "pokemon|pet" } |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName
```

Open the development settings file:

```powershell
notepad "$env:APPDATA\pokemon-pet\setting.json"
```

### Linux

User-data folder: `~/.config/pokemon-pet/`

Locate the settings file:

```bash
find "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}" -maxdepth 3 -name setting.json 2>/dev/null | grep -Ei "pokemon|pet"
```

Open the development settings file with the default application:

```bash
xdg-open "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/pokemon-pet/setting.json"
```

Bundled pet packs are copied into `pets/` when missing. Existing user copies are never overwritten, so prompts, sprites, behavior, and themes can be edited directly.
